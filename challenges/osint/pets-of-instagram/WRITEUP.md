# pets of instagram

First we are given an instagram account name @peanut_the_pommy. Going on to this account, we see that there is a picture of the toys. This confirms that this is the correct account. 

If we then look at the 'Following' list, we see @liam_p_smith23. Remember we are looking for the dad, so out of everyone, this seems to be the most likely. When you click on his account, it says "Follow me on Twitter at @liam_p_smith23"

Going on Twitter (or now known as X), we see them say "phew, luckily I deleted the tweet containing my last name. Hmm so clearly it has been deleted...

Perhaps after some research, you stumble on something called the Wayback Machine, a digital archive of webpages.

Putting in the Twitter url, you can see it was saved 4 times, checking July 3, 2021 gets you the middle name. "Oh darn it, you've found this tweet. My middle name is Phineas.

Therefore peanut's dad's full name is Liam Phineas Smith.
